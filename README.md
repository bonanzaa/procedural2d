# procedural2d
Very crude caveman implementation of Perlin Noise/Diamond Square algorithms to generate 2D Terrain in Unity

# Barebones setup
- Clone repo, copy "Perlin" folder into your Assets folder
- Slap those two bad boys onto an empty object in your scene

- You also need a mesh to display the generated map with custom **Unlit** material (if you want a display anyways)
